                    In the mirror of the next five years, I see a 
                    reflection of uncertainty. The struggle is real, 
                    trying to pinpoint where I'll stand, for 
                    I am the jack of all trades but master of none. 
                    Proficient in the basics of everything, yet unable 
                    to claim mastery in a single realm. It's a challenge 
                    that often feels like drowning, torn between paths, 
                    unsure of which career road to tread.
               </p>
               <p>
                    Hold up, because the dreams and goals of little Naoe 
                    are the fuel that propels me forward on this journey 
                    called life. Back in the day, my younger 
                    self vibed with rap, and I've got to honor that passion. 
                    Fast forward five years, I envision a version of myself 
                    capable of renting a studio, crafting beats, 
                    and penning rhymes.
               </p>
               <p>
                    Through the rhythm and rhyme, I aspire to spread 
                    positivity and inspire a generation to be agents of 
                    change. The journey ahead is a melody waiting to be 
                    composed, and I'm determined to let the music be 
                    a force for good in the world.
               </p>
               <p>
                    But I need a stable source of income first. That's 
                    why I chose I.T.; it's the most fitting course for 
                    me, considering my high school explorations. Back 
                    then, I delved into inappropriate online activities, 
                    dabbling in phishing and creating Facebook backdoors 
                    to hack into accounts. It's not something I'm proud of, 
                    but it was a phase that opened my eyes
               </p>
               <p>
                    In those moments of little Naoe's hacking hobby, 
                    I see a potential future for myself.
                    I see a career in cyber security as a 
                    pentester or SOC analyst. 
                    The skills I once used for the wrong reasons 
                    have transformed into tools for safeguarding and 
                    securing digital landscapes.

               <p>             
                    I envision myself in either of these two careers‚Äîeither 
                    as a rapper or in the field of cybersecurity. 
                    Both paths hold the promise of financial stability, 
                    the opportunity to travel to different countries, 
                    and the ability to give back to my loved ones. 
                    Each choice carries its unique rhythm, whether 
                    through the beats of my lyrics or the security of 
                    digital landscapes, paving the way for a future 
                    where my passions align with prosperity.
